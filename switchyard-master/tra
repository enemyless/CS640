You can rerun with the -v flag to include full dumps of packets that
may have caused errors. (By default, only relevant packet context may
be shown, not the full contents.)


I'm throwing you into the Python debugger (pdb) at the point of failure.
If you don't want pdb, use the --nopdb flag to avoid this fate.

    - Type "help" or "?" to get a list of valid debugger commands.
    - Type "exit" to get out.
    - Type "where" or "bt" to print a full stack trace.
    - You can use any valid Python commands to inspect variables
